With ocean.js, you can:

- **Publish** data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data.
  Ocean creates a new [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md)
  datatoken for each dataset / data service.
- **Mint** datatokens for the service
- **Sell** datatokens via an OCEAN-datatoken Balancer pool (for auto price discovery), or for a fixed price
- **Stake** OCEAN on datatoken pools
- **Consume** datatokens, to access the service
- **Transfer** datatokens to another owner, and **all other ERC20 actions**
  using [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.9/web3-eth-contract.html) etc.

ocean.js is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com) toolset.

This is in alpha state and you can expect running into problems. If you run into them, please open up a [new issue](/issues).

## üèó Installation

```bash
npm install @oceanprotocol/lib
```

## üèÑ Quickstart

```ts
import { Ocean, Config, ConfigHelper, Logger } from '@oceanprotocol/lib'

const defaultConfig: Config = new ConfigHelper().getConfig(
  'rinkeby',
  'YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'
)

const config = {
  ...defaultConfig,
  metadataCacheUri: 'https://your-metadata-cache.com',
  providerUri: 'https://your-provider.com'
}

async function init() {
  const ocean = await Ocean.getInstance(config)
  return ocean
}
```

### Simple Flow

This stripped-down flow shows the essence of Ocean. Just downloading, no metadata.

[Go to simple flow](docs/quickstart_simple.md)

### Marketplace Flow

This batteries-included flow includes metadata, multiple services for one datatoken, and compute-to-data.

[Go to marketplace flow](docs/quickstart_marketplace.md)

## ü¶ë Development

The project is authored with TypeScript and compiled with `tsc`.

To start compiler in watch mode:

```bash
npm start
```

## ‚ú® Code Style

For linting and auto-formatting you can use from the root of the project:

```bash
# lint all js with eslint
npm run lint

# auto format all js & css with prettier, taking all configs into account
npm run format
```

## üë©‚Äçüî¨ Testing

Test suite for unit & integration tests is setup with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) as test runner, and [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) for coverage reporting. A combined coverage report is sent to CodeClimate via Travis.

Running all tests requires running Ocean Protocol components beforehand with [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge), which also runs a `ganache-cli` instance:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge
cd barge

./start_ocean.sh --with-provider2 --no-dashboard
```

You can then proceed to run in another terminal.

Let ocean.js know where to pickup the smartcontract addresses:
```
export ADDRESS_FILE="${HOME}/.ocean/ocean-contracts/artifacts/address.json"
```

Build metadata:
```
npm run build
```

Executing linting, type checking, unit, and integration tests with coverage reporting all in one go:

```bash
npm test
```

### Unit Tests

You can execute the unit tests individually with:

```bash
npm run test:unit
# same thing, but with coverage reporting
npm run test:unit:coverage
```

### Integration Tests

You can execute the integration tests individually with:

```bash
npm run test:integration
# same thing, but with coverage reporting
npm run test:integration:coverage
```

## üõ≥ Production

To create a production build, run from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Releases

Releases are managed semi-automatically. They are always manually triggered from a developer's machine with release scripts.

### Production

From a clean `main` branch you can run the release task bumping the version accordingly based on semantic versioning:

```bash
npm run release
```

The task does the following:

- bumps the project version in `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- auto-generates and updates the CHANGELOG.md file from commit messages
- creates a Git tag
- commits and pushes everything
- creates a GitHub release with commit messages as description
- Git tag push will trigger Travis to do a npm release

For the GitHub releases steps a GitHub personal access token, exported as `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required. [Setup](https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases)
